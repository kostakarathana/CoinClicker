# CoinClicker â€” Frontend demo

This is a minimal React (Vite) scaffold for the CoinClicker hackathon demo.

Quick start:

```bash
# install
npm install

# dev server
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This repo intentionally starts with a demo-mode single-page app. We'll wire real-time and Flare/XRPL integrations after you confirm the app spec.
- Always follow the hackathon rules: Flare + XRPL only for blockchain interactions.
